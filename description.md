# ML Model Experimentation Branch

## Overview
This branch contains experimental machine learning models for automated data categorization. The goal is to evaluate and compare different ML approaches to determine the most effective solution for our classification needs.

## Models Under Investigation
We are experimenting with the following algorithms:
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for robust classification
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline statistical model for binary/multiclass classification
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning approach for complex pattern recognition

## Data Processing Pipeline
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Text vectorization for feature extraction
- **Text Segmentation**: Breaking down input data into meaningful units
- **Additional preprocessing techniques**: [To be documented as implemented]

## Experiment Tracking
All experiments, findings, and results are documented in this file to maintain a clear record of:
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Hyperparameter configurations tested
- Comparative analysis between approaches
- Insights and lessons learned
- Recommended next steps
